A milter (mail filter) that checks whether the MTA is likely to be able to
deliver a mail message to a next hop MX. This can be useful if one of the
primary jobs of the MTA is to forward mail on to another MTA, or if the MTA
acts as a secondary for a set of domains.

The goal is to avoid generating backscatter. The milter tries to avoid
accepting mail that will not be deliverable, since once the MTA accepts a
message into its queue, it becomes its responsibility to send delivery status
notifications. In particular, it's desirable to avoid sending DSNs for spam
(this backscatter just adds to the spam problem), and a lot of spam tends to be
uundeliverable. Even worse, many of the DSNs will themselves be undeliverable,
since the sender address is usually forged. That means that the postmaster
mailbox becomes unreadable, because it fills up with all the undeliverable
DSNs.

Since one of the purposes of an MTA being able to send mail to a next
hop is to be able to queue messages while the next hop is not available,
milter-checkrcpt keeps a database of results from past checks, and uses
that database when the next-hop MTA is not available to check in real
time.
