# Upstream regularly breaks protocol compatibility.  While users of
# pkgsrc syncthing on multiple systems can update synchronously, an
# important use case is interoperating with syncthing-android.
# Therefore, pkgsrc will update to a new major version (e.g. 0.12.x vs
# 0.11.x) when a corresponding syncthing-android version becomes
# available in the f-droid.org repository:
# https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid
# Updates to new major versions must be tested against the android
# version from f-droid prior to commiting.  (This is an attempt to
# avoid having to version syncthing in pkgsrc.)
# Note that the android versioning is disconnected from syncthing versioning;
# see https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues/652 for
# a fuller explanation.
